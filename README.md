# Clone Public Repositories for Github User

## Setup

to clone this repository:

            git clone

To run this script :
            
```cd clonePublicRepos ```

``` chmod +x cloneRepos.sh ```

followed by...

``` ./cloneRepos.sh ```

## About

Enter your github username and this script will clone all your public repositories into a new folder with sub folders for each repository. I wanted to learn Bash and create something simple that I will probably need in the future, and this does both!
