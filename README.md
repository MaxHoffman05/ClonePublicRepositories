# Clone Public Repositories for Associated Github User

## Setup

to clone this repository:

            git clone https://github.com/MaxHoffman05/ClonePublicRepositories

To run this script :
            
```cd clonePublicRepos ```

``` chmod +x cloneRepos.sh ```

followed by...

``` ./cloneRepos.sh ```

## About

Enter your github username and this script will clone all your public repositories into a new folder with sub folders for each repository. I wanted to learn Bash and create something simple that I will probably need in the future, and this does both! 

<i>Keep in mind this script is not authenticated so you will be limited to the max of 60 requests per hour</i>
